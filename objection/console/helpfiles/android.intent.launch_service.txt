Command: android intent launch_service

Usage: android intent launch_service <service class>

Launches an exported service class by building a new Intent and running startActivity()
with it as an argument. The Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK flag is added to achieve
this, with the side effect that the history stack may be reset.

Examples:
   android intent launch_service com.test.example.PingService
   android intent launch_service com.test.example.utils.SyncService
