Command: ios keychain clear

Usage: ios keychain clear

Clears all the keychain items for the current application. This is achieved by
iterating over the keychain type classes available in iOS and populating a search
dictionary with them. This dictionary is then used as a query to SecItemDelete(),
deleting the entries.
Items that will be deleted include everything stored with the entitlement group used
during the patching/signing process.

Examples:
   ios keychain clear
