Command: ios keychain dump

Usage: ios keychain dump (optional: --json <filename>)

Extracts the keychain items for the current application. This is achieved by iterating
over the keychain type classes available in iOS and populating a search dictionary
with them. This dictionary is then used as a query to SecItemCopyMatching() and the
results parsed.
Items that will be accessible include everything stored with the entitlement group used
during the patching/signing process.
Providing a filename with the --json flag will dump all of the keychain attributes
to the file specified for later inspection.

Examples:
   ios keychain dump
   ios keychain dump --json keychain.json
