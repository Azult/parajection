Command: memory search

Usage: memory search "<pattern>" (optional: --string)

Search the current processes' heap for a pattern. A pattern is represented by a
byte sequence such as eb ff aa. It is also possible to specify wildcards such as
eb ff ?? aa, indicating that you are looking for a pattern that starts with eb ff,
has any other byte and then has aa.
It is also possible to  provide a raw string, which should be suffixed with the
--string flag, indicating to the command that it should convert the string to
bytes before executing the search. Wildcards are not supported in string searches.

Examples:
   memory search "41 41 41 41"
   memory search "41 ?? de ad"
   memory search "deadbeef" --string
