Command: memory write

Usage: memory write "<address>" "<pattern>" (optional: --string)

Write an arbitrary set of bytes to an address in memory. Using this command has a high
chance of crashing the applications process if you attempt to write to addresses outside
of the applications heap, or your bytes specified cause to go outside of some memory
boundary.

Examples:
   memory write 0x117a2e347 "ff 41 41 42"
