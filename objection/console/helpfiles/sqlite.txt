Contains subcommands to work with SQLite databases on the remote device.
Connecting to a SQLite database will result in a copy of the database from
the remote device being downloaded locally. All queries that are run will
be run on the locally cached database. If the changes need to be available
on the remote device, the database should be `sync`'ed back.
