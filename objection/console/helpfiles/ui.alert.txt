Command: ui alert

Usage: ui alert (optional: "<alert message>")

Displays an alert popup on iOS devices, or a Toast message on Android devices.
This is useful to demonstrate that the application was successfully hooked. Providing
an alert message will display that message instead of the default.
Note: Currently, once the iOS alert message has been displayed, dismissing the message
unfortunately crashes the application.

Examples:
   ui alert
   ui alert 'custom message!'
